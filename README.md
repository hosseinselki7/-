A funny hyper realistic video of a cute brown dog standing in front of a large cannabis farm, smiling with a mischievous and satisfied expression. The scene starts with the camera zooming in on the dog’s face as it squints its eyes and smiles widely, looking extremely relaxed and happy. The camera then slowly pans out to reveal endless rows of tall green cannabis plants swaying gently in the breeze under a cloudy sky. The dog looks around slowly, sniffing the air, and gives a cheeky side-eye glance at the camera. Soft comedic background music plays, and text appears saying “When you find the good stuff.” The lighting is natural daylight with cinematic focus depth, ultra detailed textures on the dog’s fur, nose, and eyes, realistic farm environment, and a funny, wholesome, and slightly mischievous mood
